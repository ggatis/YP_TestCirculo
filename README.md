This project is designed for Yellow Pill to test the functionality of the CircularBuffer in conjunction with the Pipe and Processor objects.
The data is sent via SerialUSB and placed into the CircularBuffer while its size is 10 symbols or the timeout equal to 2s is elapsed when content of the CircularBuffer is printed back.
The code is provided on an "AS IS" basis without any warranties in the hope that it will be useful.
